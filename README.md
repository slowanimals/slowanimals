Hello! My name is Kaush 👾 

I am a 3rd year student at UCSC studying Computer Science  

My forte is programming in Python, C, and C++. I currently have a good amount of experience in ML & frontend development but am trying get better at OS development and neural networks.  

In my free time I play the violin, read scifi novels, and play on my 3ds (fav game is Ocarina of Time ).
