Hello! My name is Kaush 👾 

I am a 3rd year student at UCSC studying Computer Science. 

My forte is programming in Python, C, and C++. I currently have a good amount of experience in frontend development but am trying to work on OS development and applied ML. 

In my free time I play the violin, read scifi novels, and play on my 3ds (fav game is Ocarina of Time ).
