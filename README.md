Hello! My name is Kaush 👾 

I am a 3rd year student at UCSC studying Computer Science. 

I enjoy programming in Python, C, and C++. I have a lot of experience in frontend development but am trying to work on OS development and applied ML. 

In my free time I play the violin, talk to cats, and play on my 3ds (favorite game is Ocarina of Time).
